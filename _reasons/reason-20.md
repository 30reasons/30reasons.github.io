Liberal initiatives and forward-thinking policy are nothing if they’re up against a court system hellbent on shutting them down. The Supreme Court, which has leaned right for nearly half a century, currently has an empty chair, the keys to which will be handed to the next president. That president’s judicial appointment could swing the court’s ideological compass to the left—a colossally progressive shift whose impact on society will likely long outlive either candidate's governmental legacy. Presidents are for now; Justices are forever.
