If this list of experience and achievements belonged to a man, would we need to defend him so vehemently? Likewise, if a woman had five children with three different men and ran six different companies into bankruptcy, would she even make it to the primaries? As a society, we must change the double standard we have for women and men. Not only is Hillary the most intelligent, experienced, and trustworthy candidate in this election (by far!), having a woman in the White House will make all of us more conscious of our systemic and cultural sexism. And only when we acknowledge prejudice, can we eradicate it.
