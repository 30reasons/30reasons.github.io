Throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump had consistently echoed stories my grandfather, a Berliner who barely escaped Nazi Germany in 1938, told me about Hitler’s rise to power. They both singled out ethnic minorities to blame all of society’s problems on. They both wanted to control the media. They both share a complete disregard for the truth. Trump scares me. In answer to his question. “What have you got to lose?” I answer, everything.
