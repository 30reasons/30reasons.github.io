This election is unlike any other: urgent and global issues at stake have receded into the background, overwhelmed by the invective toxic nonsense of the campaign. Our approach emphasizes the sense of urgency beyond the presidential race back to the issues that effect us all. Clearly Hillary is the choice we need to make, but the call to register your democratic opinion has never felt more critical. Because it matters.
