Republicans seem fond of the idea that we should all take responsibility for our actions, despite what we may have inherited in life. But where is that sentiment when it comes to climate change? America is one of the biggest perpetrators of the habits that cause climate change. From our single-use plastic wreaking havoc on our oceans and waterways, to consuming and discarding cheap clothing—our belief that it’s someone else’s problem, or that it isn’t a problem at all, is deplorable.
