Donald Trump wants an alt-right media empire much more than he wants to be our President. So he’s playing a role—spouting rhetoric that he doesn’t believe while serving as a mouthpiece for those who do. When this election is over, he'll be laughing on his way to the bank. And our country will be left trying to find a way to turn it all off.
