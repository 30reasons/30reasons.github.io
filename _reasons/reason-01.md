So much about Hillary Rodham’s 1969 Student Commencement Speech is remarkable. She ended with this quote. But it’s really about how she started. She started by saying “Part of the problem with just empathy with professed goals is that empathy doesn't do us anything. We’ve had lots of empathy; we’ve had lots of sympathy, but we feel that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible.” Give us access to affordable healthcare. Make debt-free college available for everyone. Ensure that black men live their lives without being targeted. Respect women. Celebrate women. Elect women.
