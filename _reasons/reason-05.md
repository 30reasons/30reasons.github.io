It’s tiring to keep fighting for the things that my mother and grandmother have had to fight for—paid family leave, safe and easy access to birth control and abortion, equal pay. But Hillary isn’t tired. She’s been fighting for women and girls her whole life and she just won’t quit. I need her to be my president.
