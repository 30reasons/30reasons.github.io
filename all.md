When 30 Reasons first formed in 2008, it was a time of great optimism. America was on the verge electing its first black President, a candidate who stood for hope and change. In the 8 years that followed, that change looked beautiful: universal healthcare, marriage equality, an end to the Iraq war.

This year is different. The election is still about change, but the change Donald Trump promises is ugly: a return to isolationism, an embrace of bigotry, a celebration of ignorance and greed. This is change we cannot afford.

We believe that Hillary Clinton is the only candidate that can continue the progress that started in 2008. She will spend the next eight years fighting for people of all races, creeds, and values. She knows that in America, a person’s worth doesn’t depend on where they were born or who they were born to.

It is with her that we raise our voices and cast our votes.
