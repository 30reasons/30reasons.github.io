# 30 Reasons

30 Reasons is a 30-poster campaign encouraging voters to support Hillary Clinton for President. The project is organized and curated by Chris and Julia Thomas. They are partners at [Hieronymus](http://www.hieronymus.co), and believe that designers have the duty to stand up, speak out, and help promote social justice.
